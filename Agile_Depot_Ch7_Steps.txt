Agile Development Depot Application

Chapter 7 - Testing and Validation - Iteration B

Controller Test - Built-in

found in: ...test/controllers/...

Add data validations to the product model class to result in for product.rb:

class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :title, :description, :image_url, presence: true
  validates :price, numericality: {greater_than_or_equal_to: 0.01}
  validates :title, uniqueness: true
  validates :image_url, allow_blank: true, format: {
    with:    %r{\.(gif|jpg|png)\Z}i,
    message: 'must be a URL for GIF, JPG or PNG image.'
  }
end

now, test:

depot> rake test

expect failure as valid test data missing...
add test data to the controller test file: products_controller_test.rb

depot> rake test 

OK!


Unit Test - Validation Example - Test a data 'unit'

test is found and named as: ...test/models/...

can be self contained in ...test/models/product_test.rb

test with:

depot> rake test:models

make assertions, manage test data, all within the product_test.rb file


Test Fixtures

fixtures found in ...test/fixtures/...

are YAML format named like .../test/fixtures/products.yml 

and contain named cases that can be called from within test scripts
