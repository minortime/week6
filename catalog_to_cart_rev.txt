A. Creating a Store display page at store#index

1. create a Store controller
	...$ rails generate controller Store index

2. now, insert into the .../app/config/routes.rb file a new root route like:
	root 'store#index'
   comment out any other root records by putting the # tag before like
	#root 'products#index'

3. run C9 server to test
	...$ rails s -b $IP -p $PORT
	
4. to list all products in the store index page, we need to set up data statement in Store controller index method.
   in the .../app/controllers/store_controller.rb file add
	@products = Product.order(:title)
   between the def index & end statements

5. now, copy the product display statements we already have in the .../app/views/product/index.html.erb 
   insert these into the similar section of the (mostly blank) .../app/views/store/index.html.erb

6. test again and you should see a bootstrapped store#index page showing the three seeded items
	migration error would generally mean you didn't migrate the db
	migrate and seed use ...$ rails db:migrate and the ...$ rails db:seed
	
7. use a helper to format the price in .../app/views/store/index.html.erb as a currency like 
	number_to_currency(product.price)
	
   	note: other helpers we use include: strip_tags() and image_tag() and sanitize()


B. Creating a Cart and LineItem objects for session-level shopping

1. create the Cart
	...$ rails generate scaffold Cart
	
   scaffolding creates a model, so run the migration
	...$ rails db:migrate
	
2. create the new file .../app/controllers/concerns/current_cart.rb with contents

	module CurrentCart
	
	  private
	
	    def set_cart 
	      @cart = Cart.find(session[:cart_id])
	    rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
	      @cart = Cart.create
	      session[:cart_id] = @cart.id
	    end
	end

   this will be how  we test for the presence or absence of a shopping cart

3. generate by scaffold the LineItems entity that will hold cart purchase information

	...$ rails generate scaffold LineItem product:references cart:belongs_to
	
   then migrate the new database table
	...$ rails db:migrate
	
4. add one line into the .../app/models/cart.rb between the Class Cart < ApplicationRecord & end 
	has_many :line_items, dependent: :destroy
   this will let us use object calls like: {cart.line_items.count}


5. modify the .../app/models/product.rb file by including two lines after: class Product < ApplicationRecord

   class Product < ApplicationRecord
     
     has_many :line_items
     before_destroy :ensure_not_referenced_by_any_line_item
   
   then, just before final end statement, you add a private method to test if you can delete an existing product
   this helps enforce referential integrity
   
   
     private
     # ensure that there are no line items referencing this product
       def ensure_not_referenced_by_any_line_item
        unless line_items.empty?
         errors.add(:base, 'Line Items present')
        throw :abort
        end
       end
       
     end  (Note: this is the pre-existing end statement lin in the product.rb file


6. add a button to support Add_To_Cart function in .../app/views/store/index.html.erb
	<%= button_to 'Add to Cart', line_items_path(product_id: product) %>
   place immediately after the product.price entry on the page


7. modify .../app/controllers/line_items_controller.rb to use the CurrentCart concern we created and determine when it is used.
   A. Add the following two line below the initial: class LineItemsController .... line
	include CurrentCart
	before_action :set_cart, only: [:create]
	
   B. further into the line_items_controller.rb file we need to modify the method: def create so we can use the current 
      selected product_id to find product data for the line items; insert a line immediately after: def create and add
	product = Product.find(params[:product_id])
	@line_item = @cart.line_items.build(product: product)
      then just after the line: if @line_item.save the line starting with: format.html ... should be changed to be:
	format.html { redirect_to @line_item.cart, notice: 'Line item was successfully created.' }
      this results in a message being shown by the .../app/views/carts/show.html.erb page fragment

   C. test now if you wish

8. To see some details like the title in the show result, we need to add an iteration through all of the cart items.
   To display as text or even within a panel body section we need to add for title displays:
	<ul>
	  <% @cart.line_items.each do |item| %>
	    <li><%= item.product.title %></li>
	  <% end %>
	</ul>
   it would be possible to add other information like <%= item.product.price %> to the display if interested  

9. test again if you wish

10.final steps - assuming you have viable github and heroku remotes
	test everything you can to make sure it works
	update local repository (e.g. ...$ git add -A and ...$ git commit -m "update"
        push to github (e.g. ...$ git push origin master)	
	   check and see update at github
	push to heroku (e.g. ...$ git push heroku master)
	   before testing at heroku remember database migrations and seeding
	      ...$ heroku run rails db:migrate
	      ...$ heroku run rails db:seed
